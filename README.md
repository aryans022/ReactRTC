# ReactRTC

`ReactRTC` is a live chat web application with support for both text messages and video call facilities. The app has been built using ReactJS, ExpressJS, WebRTC, Socket.io, Firebase, Azure Communication Services and MaterialUI.

Please don't try to establish a connection over wifi and a mobile network. Sometimes, the firewall blocks the webRTC UDP connection to be made. Also, the site might be a bit slow to load when you load it the first time since it is hosted on heroku.

### Choice of Technologies
---

1. ReactJS: I chose React as my frontend framework mostly because of component reusability and high community support. This has resulted in minimal repetition of code.
2. Firebase: I considered mongoDB and SQL for my database, but firebase provided a simple frontend based solution that was perfect for my use case and the allotted time. I would have had to write the server side code for the other two dbs while thatâ€™s not the case for firebase.
3. WebRTC and socket.io : I chose these to implement the video chat feature since these are the most basic tools for video conferencing on which most major SDKs/apps are built. This would result in much higher learning.
4. MaterialUI: Built purely for React, unlike bootstrap.
5. ExpressJS: Easy to configure and use with react and socket.io
